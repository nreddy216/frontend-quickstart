## About

This is a very basic, lightweight ES6, Webpack 4, SASS template.

Do you have a quick one-page prototype you want to try out? Want to make a JS app without using a heavy framework? Then this is the template for you.

## Get started

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## What this doesn't currently have

- Currently if you want multiple pages, you would create a new directory within `static` with its corresponding `index.html`. This could be less clunky.

- Another thing I'd want to eventually add is a templating library.

- Deployment process - you're on your own here.
